# TDeck

Taya's project to make an app that turns your phone into a fantasy cyberdeck
(aka Taya realized she doesn't need to buy a clockworkpi uConsole since she already has hardware xD)

## Structure

The system will run one program at a time, the main program will be a terminal which you can then use to switch to another program.
Once you quit that other program, you'll be put back into the terminal.

## Rendering API
- tools for rendering textual (terminal like) interfaces
- tools for easily adding custom soft keyboards
- custom drawing for more complex ui

## Programs

### Terminal
- Main display area
- Input area (soft keyboard)
